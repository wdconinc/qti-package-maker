# Changelog

## 2026-05-03

### Additions and New Features
- Add `CALC` item type: arithmetic / formula questions where variable placeholders
  (`[varname]` syntax) are randomised each attempt and a formula string determines the
  expected answer.  Supported in `canvas_qti_v1_2` (Canvas `calculated_question`),
  `bbq_text_upload` (Blackboard `FIL`), `html_selftest` (JS `new Function` formula
  evaluator with percentage-tolerance check), and `human_readable` (labelled text block).
  Blackboard QTI 2.1 engines (`blackboard_qti_v2_1`, `bb_ultra_qti_v2_1`) return `None`
  (item silently skipped) pending a proprietary extension reference sample.
- Add `validate_CALC` in `qti_package_maker/assessment_items/validator.py` covering
  variable spec checks (min < max, non-negative decimal_places), placeholder presence in
  question text, formula allowlist (alphanumerics, arithmetic operators, math function
  names), forbidden-token rejection (`import`, `eval`, `exec`, `__`), tolerance range
  (0 < pct <= 100), and a trial evaluation with min variable values.
- Add `qti_package_maker/engines/html_selftest/add_CALC.py` with scoped JS that randomises
  variable values on `DOMContentLoaded`, substitutes them into the displayed question text,
  and evaluates the formula via `new Function` on Check Answer.
- Add `qti_package_maker/engines/canvas_qti_v1_2/item_xml_helpers.py`
  `create_CALC_item_proc_extension` helper that builds the `<itemproc_extension><calculated>`
  block with deterministic var-sets (10 evenly spaced draws).
- Add `docs/CALC_DESIGN.md`: architecture decision record covering data model, formula
  security, CRC derivation, engine mapping, and open questions.
- Update `docs/QUESTION_TYPES.md`, `docs/ENGINES.md`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` to document
  the new CALC type.
- Add unit tests: `test_validate_calc_*` (8 cases in `tests/unit/test_validator.py`),
  `test_qti12_calc_item_structure` (Canvas XML structural check), BBQ `FIL` format test,
  and HTML selftest JS presence test; extend `test_html_selftest_outputs_are_valid_html`
  to cover CALC.

### Fixes and Maintenance
- Fix `qti_package_maker/engines/blackboard_qti_v2_1/engine_class.py` `save_package` to
  return `None` early when all items in the bank produce no output (empty
  `assessment_file_name_list`), preventing a spurious `ValueError` when a bank contains
  only unsupported item types for that engine.



### Additions and New Features
- Add `docs/BLACKBOARD_ULTRA_NOTES.md`, the empirical contract for what Blackboard Ultra accepts, rewrites, and destroys on QTI 2.1 import/export. Derived from one manual round trip of `output/ultra_probe.zip` through an Ultra sandbox; re-export preserved in [ULTRA/ultra_probe-roundtrip/](../ULTRA/ultra_probe-roundtrip/).
- Patch 6 (Ultra engine scaffolding): implement complete item writer pipeline for Blackboard Ultra QTI 2.1. Add `qti_package_maker/engines/bb_ultra_qti_v2_1/item_xml_helpers.py` with Ultra-native QTI element builders (Ultra-shaped responseDeclaration with cardinality="multiple" for MC/MA, unpadded answer_N identifiers, double-div itemBody wrapping, SCORE+FEEDBACKBASIC+MAXSCORE outcomes). Add `qti_package_maker/engines/bb_ultra_qti_v2_1/write_item.py` with per-item-type dispatch (MC, MA, FIB, NUM, MULTI_FIB, MATCH; NO ORDER). Add `qti_package_maker/engines/bb_ultra_qti_v2_1/assessment_meta.py` manifest and question_bank builders with canonical Ultra resource structure and 5-digit zero-padded item identifiers. Add `qti_package_maker/engines/bb_ultra_qti_v2_1/engine_class.py` extending BaseEngine with full ZIPing pipeline: calls `type_normalize.normalize_items()` to drop ORDER items with warnings, dispatches to write_item per type, writes items to `qti21/assessmentItemNNNNN.xml`, writes manifest and question_bank, zips with `csfiles/home_dir/` empty directory. Engine auto-discovered by `engine_registration.py`. Add 4 comprehensive integration tests in `tests/integration/test_ultra_engine_smoke.py` covering single MC item, multi-type bundle with ORDER drop verification, manifest structure validation, and question_bank structure validation (all 4 tests pass).
- Milestone 10 partial (CLI + docs + tests): Add `--ultra` (`-u`) CLI flag to `tools/bbq_converter.py` for easy access to the `bb_ultra_qti_v2_1` engine (also available as `--qti21-ultra` long form). Add new `bb_ultra_qti_v2_1` section to `docs/ENGINES.md` documenting the engine, CLI flag, supported item types (MC, MA, FIB, NUM, MULTI_FIB, MATCH), unsupported types (ORDER), and key differences from the Learn engine (HTML sanitization, heading level shift, no column width control, underline loss, no inline images, Hot Spot non-round-trip stability). Update capability tables in `docs/ENGINES.md` to include the new engine (can_write: yes, can_read: no) and its item type support matrix. Add integration test `test_bbq_converter_ultra_flag()` to `tests/integration/test_bbq_converter_cli.py` verifying the `-u` flag produces a valid output ZIP (test passes).

### Fixes and Maintenance
- Ultra engine: fix a false positive in `_is_hiding_style` that was dropping every table cell with `background-color: white` (or `#ffffff`, or `border-color: white`). The check was substring-based and matched `color:white` inside `background-color:white`, nuking cell content. Rewrite the matcher to split the style on `;`, split each declaration on `:`, and require an EXACT property-name match (e.g. `prop == "color"`). Value checks remain substring so `1px !important` still matches. Two new regression tests: one that asserts every variant of white-background declaration survives, and one that passes a plain Michaelis-Menten-shaped data table through and confirms every cell value is preserved.
- Ultra engine: add a `_drop_hidden_elements` phase to `html_sanitize.py` that runs BEFORE the style-strip phase and drops (tag + content) any element whose `style=` attribute contains a CSS-hiding signature (`font-size: 1px`, `font-size: 0`, `color: white`, `color: #fff`, `color: #ffffff`, `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, `opacity: 0`). Reason: anti-cheat helpers in the upstream biology-problems repo sprinkle `<span style='font-size: 1px; color: white;'>word</span>` into question text as a distribution-tracking deterrent. Ultra strips every style attribute on import, which would promote these hidden words to visible garbage and destroy the question. The new phase drops them in-engine so the cheat-deterrent behavior is simply lost (rather than corrupted) on the Ultra path. Each dropped element is replaced with a single space so adjacent words do not collapse together (`The<span>cheat</span>following` -> `The following`, not `Thefollowing`); the anti-cheat pipeline emits hidden spans as replacements for inter-word spaces, so silent removal was collapsing neighbors. Add four pytest cases: the canonical anti-cheat span, a sweep of CSS-hide variants, the word-boundary preservation check, and an idempotence check (space replacement must not keep growing on repeated sanitization).
- Ultra engine: thread `package_name` into `assessment_meta.generate_question_bank()` and use a humanized form of it as the `assessmentTest/@title` instead of the hardcoded literal `"Test Bank"`. Humanizer replaces underscores with spaces but keeps hyphens (which often carry meaning, like the trailing `-Km` in `michaelis_menten_table-Km`). The Ultra UI now shows the actual package name as the upload title.

### Decisions and Failures
- **`<pre>` is functionally equivalent to `<p>` in Ultra.** The `<pre>` tag survives round trip, but every whitespace semantic is destroyed: newlines collapse to spaces, runs of spaces collapse to single spaces, tabs collapse to single spaces. Confirmed by probe items 1 (pre_alignment), 2 (pre_vs_p), and 7 (whitespace_stress). Kills the planned `<pre>` + tabulate table strategy entirely.
- **`&#xa0;` runs and `<br/>` are the only reliable layout primitives.** Five-nbsp runs and five-br runs survive round trip byte-for-byte (probe items 3 and 4). The new `bb_ultra_qti_v2_1` engine will use `<p>` with nbsp padding and `<br/>` row separators as its sole table strategy - no fallback ladder.
- **`<img>` is structurally broken on Ultra re-export.** Probe item 15 showed Ultra replaces the `src` with a null-file WebDAV stub, drops the referenced PNG from `csfiles/home_dir/`, and turns the self-closing `<img/>` into a wrapper that absorbs subsequent siblings as children. The engine will strip `<img>` unconditionally.
- **All CSS is stripped.** `style=` attributes on spans and blocks, `<style>` tags, and `class=` attributes are all removed on re-export (probe item 14). No narrow property allowlist survives; even the text color and font size the WYSIWYG editor shows while authoring do not round-trip. CSS is a non-feature.
- **Ultra shifts heading levels down by 1.** `<h3>` becomes `<h4>`, `<h4>` becomes `<h5>` (probe item 13). The engine will emit `<h4>`/`<h5>` directly.
- **`<hr/>`, `<blockquote>`, and `<kbd>` are stripped.** Content of `<blockquote>` and `<kbd>` is preserved, wrapper removed. `<hr/>` disappears entirely.
- **Deprecated presentational attributes are stripped.** `border`, `cellpadding`, `cellspacing`, `align`, `width`, `bgcolor` all removed from `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>` (probe item 8). Table tags survive structurally but render as a single-column vertical stack - not usable for layout.
- **`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>` are rewritten.** `<b>` to `<strong>`, `<i>` to `<em>`, `<u>` to an attribute-less `<span>` (underline visually lost).

### Fixes and Maintenance
- Purge and consolidate Ultra engine pytests to match [docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md](../docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md) PYTEST guidance. Collapse the seven new/changed test files (1881 lines, 74 tests) to five files (572 lines, 45 tests) by parametrizing granular cases, dropping brittle collection-size / hardcoded-identifier / navigation-mode asserts, merging smoke and full integration suites into `tests/integration/test_ultra_engine.py`, deleting `tests/integration/test_existing_engines_unchanged.py` (duplicate of `tests/test_all_engines.py`), and removing standalone idempotence tests covered by a single complex-mixed-case test. Swap `len(match1.prompts_list) == 4` (a trivial collection-size check) for a content assertion that every original ORDER label survives the MATCH shuffle. All 45 consolidated tests pass; pyflakes clean.
- Patch 7 (Ultra engine manifest alignment audit): audit the `bb_ultra_qti_v2_1` engine's manifest builders (`assessment_meta.py`) against canonical Ultra re-export shapes from the probe round-trip (`ULTRA/ultra_probe-roundtrip/`). Test `generate_manifest(2)` and `generate_question_bank(2)` in isolation by calling functions directly and comparing serialized output against canonical files. Finding: manifest builders produce structurally identical XML. Differences are formatting only (lxml pretty_print vs minified) and assessmentTest @title (generic "Test Bank" vs probe-specific "Ultra Probe"), both acceptable and documented. No code changes to manifest builders required. Pyflakes clean. Note: full end-to-end smoke test is blocked by pre-existing M6 defect in `compat_gate.py` where the allowed_tags set uses lowercase names but QTI XML has camelCase tags; documented in BLACKBOARD_ULTRA_NOTES.md as a known M8 issue.
- Append "Generated manifest vs. canonical reference" subsection to [docs/BLACKBOARD_ULTRA_NOTES.md](../docs/BLACKBOARD_ULTRA_NOTES.md) documenting M7 audit methodology, findings (no structural differences), acceptable differences rationale, and a new "Known issues" section documenting the pre-existing M6 compat_gate defect.
- Patch 8 (Ultra engine compat_gate): implement `qti_package_maker/engines/bb_ultra_qti_v2_1/compat_gate.py` with `UltraCompatibilityError` exception class and `validate_assessment_items()` function. Gate enforces eight hard-fail rules (XML must round-trip through lxml.etree; correctResponse values must match simpleChoice identifiers; no style= or class= attribute residue; no script/style/img elements; no disallowed tags in itemBody; outcomeDeclaration with identifier="SCORE" must be present). Gate enforces three warn rules (unknown tags logged but not blocked; cell text >1000 chars warned; empty choiceInteraction warned). Gate accepts a list of etree.Element assessmentItem nodes and returns a list of warning strings; raises UltraCompatibilityError on hard-fail. Wire gate into `engine_class.py`'s `save_package()` to validate all items after `write_assessment_items()` but before ZIP packing. Add 10 comprehensive pytest test cases in `tests/test_ultra_compat_gate.py` (all pass) covering well-formed pass, dangling correctResponse hard-fail, style/script/img/disallowed-tag hard-fails, missing SCORE hard-fail, unknown attribute warn, oversized cell warn, empty choiceInteraction warn. Pyflakes clean.

### Developer Tests and Notes
- Patch 9 (M9 integration + regression guards): Add `tests/integration/test_existing_engines_unchanged.py` (11 tests) covering regression detection for all pre-existing engines: `blackboard_qti_v2_1`, `canvas_qti_v1_2`, `bbq_text_upload`, `html_selftest`, `exam_yaml`, `human_readable`, `moodle_aiken`, `text2qti`, `okla_chrst_bqgen`. Uses pragmatic property-based approach (not brittle byte-for-byte snapshots) to detect structural regressions: verifies each engine can output a 3-item fixture (MC, FIB, NUM), parses output, and validates presence of key structural elements (imsmanifest.xml, item files, ZIP validity). Includes test for `bbq_converter.py` default flag routing (verifies `-1` flag works without Ultra engine becoming default). All 11 tests pass. Add `tests/integration/test_ultra_engine_full.py` (8 tests) as comprehensive Ultra integration test suite: tests full item-type range (MC, MA, FIB, NUM, MULTI_FIB, MATCH, ORDER with skip), manifest XML validity, SCORE outcome declarations, question_bank item reference counts, csfiles directory presence, correctResponse identifier validity, style attribute stripping in itemBody, and round-trip XML re-parsing invariant. All 8 tests pass. Verify `test_all_engines.py` already includes the new `bb_ultra_qti_v2_1` engine via auto-registration (no code changes required). Test suite now includes 51 existing Ultra unit tests + 4 smoke tests + 8 full integration tests + 11 regression guard tests = 74 new/extended tests for Ultra. Pyflakes clean across all test files.
- Add `tools/build_ultra_probe.py`, a throwaway script that emits `output/ultra_probe.zip` containing 15 small MC probe items targeting one Blackboard Ultra HTML/structural sanitizer dimension each (`<pre>`, `&nbsp;` columns, bare `<table>`, cell structure variants, whitespace, inline formatting, lists, headings, entities, `style=` and `<style>`, `<img>`). The ZIP is cloned from the shape of `ULTRA/manually-created-ultra-question/` (compact manifest with `csm`/`imsqti` namespaces, `qti21/question_bank00001.xml` test file, `csfiles/home_dir/probe_tiny.png` hand-built 67-byte PNG). First milestone of the new `blackboard_qti_v2_1_ultra` engine plan; the probe is the input to one manual Ultra round trip that will lock the table strategy and allowed-tag set.
- Round-trip output of the probe ZIP through the Ultra sandbox is preserved verbatim at [ULTRA/ultra_probe-roundtrip/](../ULTRA/ultra_probe-roundtrip/). All 15 items imported and re-exported as well-formed XML (every item parses under `lxml.etree`), including the structurally broken item 15 wrapper.
- Patch 3 (Ultra engine `type_normalize` stage): implement `qti_package_maker/engines/bb_ultra_qti_v2_1/type_normalize.py` with `normalize_items()` function supporting three ORDER-mapping policies (`skip`, `mc`, `match`), plus `UltraUnsupportedTypeError` for future extensibility. Add 11 pytest test cases in `tests/test_ultra_type_normalize.py` covering all policies, MC/MA/MATCH/NUM/FIB/MULTI_FIB pass-through, permutation correctness, and deterministic MATCH shuffling. All tests pass; pyflakes clean.
- Rewrite `docs/BLACKBOARD_ULTRA_NOTES.md` from scratch to reflect the post-second-probe findings. Removes the retracted nbsp-only table strategy and the "tables do not render" misdiagnosis. Adds executive summary for non-technical readers, Michaelis-Menten root cause (self-closing `<colgroup width="160"/>` HTML5 parser bug), supported question types table, Hot Spot round-trip failure, SVG non-support, canonical Ultra-native image embedding format from `ULTRA/image_test/`, and a Learn-to-Ultra porting forecast table. Suitable for sharing with non-technical stakeholders.
- Patch 4 (Ultra engine `html_sanitize` stage): implement `qti_package_maker/engines/bb_ultra_qti_v2_1/html_sanitize.py` with `sanitize_fragment()` function. Core operation: re-serialize every HTML fragment through `lxml.html.fromstring` + `lxml.html.tostring` to repair self-closing non-void tags (`<colgroup width="160"/>` -> `<colgroup></colgroup>`, the root cause of Michaelis-Menten first-import collapse). Enforces Ultra's empirical tag/attribute allowlist: keep `p`, `div`, `span`, `br`, `em`, `strong`, `sub`, `sup`, `code`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `h4`, `h5`, `table`, `tbody`, `tr`, `th`, `td`, `colgroup`, `col`, `a`; rewrite `b`->`strong`, `i`->`em`, `u`->`span`, `h1`/`h2`/`h3`->`h4`, `h4`->`h5` (with idempotence guard), `pre`->`p`; unwrap `blockquote`, `kbd`, and unknown tags; drop `script`, `style`, `img` with content. Strip attributes: `style`, `class`, `id`, `cellpadding`, `cellspacing`, `bgcolor`, `border`, `align`, `width`, `height`, `color`, `face`, `valign`, all event handlers, all namespaced attributes; preserve `<a href>` only. Add 30 comprehensive pytest cases in `tests/test_ultra_html_sanitize.py` covering colgroup repair, tag rewrites, attribute stripping, unwrapping, dropping, idempotence (all 30 cases pass including idempotence tests). No pyflakes errors.

## 2026-04-02

### Additions and New Features
- Add `exam_yaml` write-only engine that exports an ItemBank to exam YAML format for printable ODT exam generation. Supports MC, MA, MATCH, ORDER, NUM, FIB, and MULTI_FIB item types. This is an intentionally lossy export: answer keys, scoring metadata, and section structure are not preserved. Inline HTML tags (`<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<em>`) and HTML entities (`&Delta;`, `&deg;`, etc.) are passed through verbatim.

### Fixes and Maintenance
- Refactor test suite to match `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md` guidelines across all test files.
- Convert `from X import Y` and aliased `from X import Y as Z` imports to `import X` module style across ~30 test files.
- Remove try/except block in `test_all_engines.py`; engines return None for unsupported types instead of raising.
- Replace brittle `len(bank) == N` collection size assertions with behavioral checks (`len(bank) > 0`, `len(bank) > 1`, etc.) across unit and integration tests.
- Replace brittle `item_type == __class__.__name__` assertion in `test_item_types.py` with property-based check.
- Convert spaces to tabs in `test_color_wheel_next_gen.py`.
- Split oversized `test_write_html_color_table_cam16_debug` (12+ assertions) into 6 focused test functions.

## 2026-04-01

### Additions and New Features
- Add `_detect_tablefmt()` and `_has_visible_border()` helpers in `string_functions.py` that inspect HTML table border attributes to choose the appropriate tabulate format: `"fancy_grid"` for cell-level visible borders, `"plain"` for `border="0"`, and `"fancy_outline"` for table-level border with collapse.
- Add four unit tests for border-aware tablefmt detection: visible cell borders, cell `border: 0` (metabolic pathway pattern), `border="0"` attribute, and border-collapse.

### Fixes and Maintenance
- Fix `_html_table_to_text()` rendering borderless HTML tables (e.g., metabolic pathway diagrams) with box-drawing grid lines. Tables with `border: 0` on cells now correctly use plain format instead of `fancy_grid`.

### Decisions and Failures
- Reviewed all `tablefmt` calls across the codebase (5 call sites). Console display calls in `item_bank.py` and `engine_registration.py` all use `"fancy_outline"` consistently. No consolidation needed; adding a shared constant would add indirection without benefit.

## 2026-03-30

### Behavior or Interface Changes
- Rename changelog section headings to match REPO_STYLE.md spec: `Added` to `Additions and New Features`, `Changed` to `Behavior or Interface Changes`, `Fixed` to `Fixes and Maintenance`, `Removed` to `Removals and Deprecations`, `Chore` to `Fixes and Maintenance`.
- Replace backslash-escaped quotes with alternating quote styles in `html_functions.py`.
- Add return type hints to public functions in `item_types.py`, `item_bank.py`, `string_functions.py`, and `html_functions.py`.
- Refactor `from`/`as` imports to direct module imports in `test_multi_engine_roundtrip.py` and `test_html_selftest_output.py`.
- Convert 3-space indentation to tabs in `rcp_debug_plots.py`.
- Bump version from 26.02 to 26.03.
- Fix version mismatch check in `bbq_converter.py` to normalize PEP 440 versions before comparing (e.g., `26.03` vs `26.3`); use `packaging.version.Version` for proper normalization.
- Add editable-install sync check to `devel/submit_to_pypi.py` that detects stale `pip install -e .` metadata before running pytest, preventing confusing version mismatch failures.
- Add bold choice letters (A., B., C., etc.) to html_selftest MC and MA labels.
- Wrap html_selftest choice text in a `<span>` so `<sub>` and `<sup>` tags render as proper subscripts and superscripts inside flex labels.
- Add visible-text-length check to `determine_choice_layout_class()` so choices longer than 50 visible characters force vertical layout instead of grid.
- Strip HTML tags and unescape entities before measuring choice text length for layout decisions.
- Remove `__version__` assignment from `qti_package_maker/__init__.py`; version check in `bbq_converter.py` now uses `importlib.metadata.version()` directly.
- Remove re-exports and `__all__` from `color_theory/__init__.py`; all consumers already import submodules directly.
- Rename `color_theory/main.py` to `color_theory/rcp_debug_plots.py` to reflect its role as a dev visualization script.
- Move `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `scipy` from `pip_requirements.txt` to `pip_requirements-dev.txt` (only used in `rcp_debug_plots.py`).
- Remove incorrect `colour` entry from `pip_requirements.txt`; add `"colour": "colour-science"` alias to `test_import_requirements.py`.

## 2026-02-07

### Additions and New Features

- Update unit tests to use pytest tmp_path instead of hardcoded /tmp paths for Bandit compliance.
- Escape non-ISO-8859-1 characters in html_selftest HTML output with numeric entities.
- Add tests dir to sys.path in pytest conftest to allow local test imports.
- Use git rev-parse to determine REPO_ROOT in pytest conftest.
- Scope html_selftest MATCH drag-and-drop initialization by item id to avoid multi-item collisions.
- Scope html_selftest MATCH/ORDER dropzone queries to each item container and add output tests for scoping.

## 2026-01-03

### Additions and New Features
- **Planning**: Add `COLOR_WHEEL_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` with a perceptual color sampling plan and visual test notes.
- **Next-gen experiments**: Add `qti_package_maker/common/color_wheel_next_gen.py` for OKLCH-based color wheel experiments.
- **Tests**: Add pytest coverage for next-gen color wheel utilities.

### Behavior or Interface Changes
- **Refactor plan & docs**: refine hue spacing and fixed lightness bands; define even chroma via shared min max chroma; add working history; add design corrections and per-wheel policy guidance; add/remove xdark/normal policy drafts per scope; replace plan with CAM16-based plan and rollout steps; add dependency notes; keep CAM16 opt-in until default; add Remaining Items.
- **Module structure & compatibility**: move color wheel modules into `color_wheel/` with shims; expand shim exports for tests; remove OKLCH next-gen module/tests while keeping legacy in `legacy_color_wheel.py`; add deprecation warning and update tests to import legacy directly; move implementations to `color_theory/` with legacy facade; add `generate_color_wheel` facade; add legacy parity + CAM16 smoke tests.
- **CAM16 implementation & tuning**: select `colour-science` and wire CAM16 adapter/skeleton; adjust J targets (add very_dark, lighten dark/light, xdark/normal tweaks); boost dark saturation and soften light/pastel output; rotate wheels so hue 1 anchors to true red; emit legacy red RGB distance in HTML; use American spelling (except `colour-science`).
- **Debug & inspection tooling**: add CAM16 debug HTML; anchor to best-red offsets; make deterministic; add XKCD name labels; add CAM16-UCS radius/gamut margin/per-hue max-M utilization; remove M/gamut_limit from debug; add UCS target diagnostics; add control selection indicator; add clamp_reason and prefer per-hue M_max caps for UCS control; add CAM16 spec helper and J/M/Q range tests.
- **Light UCS control**: remove mode-level M caps for UCS-driven modes and skip max-M anchoring in debug/HTML for UCS modes.
- **Validation**: enforce shared_m_quantile in [0.0, 1.0] and add pytest coverage for invalid quantiles.
- **Release tooling**: remove repo-derived CLI args from `devel/submit_to_pypi.py`, require VERSION file, and fix rich stderr output.
- **Release tooling**: test installs now pin the exact version (with --pre when needed) and project URLs use canonicalized names.
- **Release tooling**: always check for existing versions; `--version-check` now runs the check and exits.
- **Release tooling**: remove clean/upgrade/test-install/open toggles and index/repo URL overrides; these steps now run unconditionally.
- **Release tooling**: add pre-checks (PEP 440 version parse, requires-python, git clean/main, version tag, twine, pytest when installed, and dist empty after clean).
- **Release tooling**: require `main` to be fully synced with `origin/main` (fetch + ahead/behind check).
- **Release tooling**: add `--build-only` mode and log build output to `build_output.log`.
- **Release tooling**: add index reachability check before version lookup.
- **Release tooling**: include prereleases when checking index versions.
- **Release tooling**: normalize version strings for index checks and test installs (e.g., 26.01rc2 -> 26.1rc2).
- **Release tooling**: retry test install when the new version is not indexed yet.
- **Release tooling**: link to the version-specific project page by default.
- **Release tooling**: add `--set-version` to bump VERSION/pyproject, commit, tag, and push.
- **Versioning**: bump VERSION/pyproject to 26.01rc2.
- **Red anchor & scan tooling**: optimize hue offsets and anchor selection; scan all offsets and choose reddest at max chroma; adjust red scoring (|G-B|/(G+B) + (G+B)/(2R)); add multi-stage best-red search, cache seeding/updates; add --best-red + red-scan HTML (coarse/fine/micro), bundle all modes, 0.2 micro step; switch CLI to argparse/named args and remove --scan-mode; treat red offsets as global per mode.
- **YAML-driven config**: add `wheel_specs.yaml` and load defaults in `wheel_specs.py`; load modes/offsets from YAML across tools; simplify YAML to per-mode `target_j`/`red_offset`; add pytest coverage for YAML mode order and offsets; enforce XOR between `shared_m_quantile` and `target_ucs_r`.
- **YAML-driven config**: remove hardcoded mode names from tests and HTML defaults; use YAML mode order everywhere.
- **Versioning**: sync `pyproject.toml` and root `VERSION` to 26.01rc1.
- **Debug & inspection tooling**: label legacy red distance output with the actual YAML mode names used.
- **HTML output**: prefer `dark`/`light`/`xlight` modes by name (when present) for the legacy-style color table columns.
- **HTML output**: require `dark`/`light`/`xlight` in YAML for the legacy table; error if missing.
- **Color name matching & deps**: add `rgb_color_name_match` using seaborn xkcd; add `seaborn` dependency; remove `webcolors`; remove `rcp-color-utils.py`.
- **Testing & engine work**: move module-level asserts into pytest; expand pytest coverage for writers/manifest/helpers/round-trips/validators/xml formatter/yaml tools/string helpers/color wheel; add round-trip coverage across BBQ/text2qti/okla_chrst_bqgen; add QTI ZIP/manifest tests and error-path coverage; fix engine selection ambiguity, item bank merge type tracking, BBQ NUM zero-division handling; update TODO/ROADMAP, mark Canvas QTI 1.2 ORDER as won't implement, expand ROADMAP priorities, and preserve legacy TODO/ROADMAP content.
